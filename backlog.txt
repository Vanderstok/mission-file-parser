-Blue flight never leaves wp_0-> eventually does. After climbing to > 800 Why? wp size?
-FLy into mountain: perhaps wait a little longer before going to WP_0???


Change log: 
-Fixed Red flight would not cover Blue flight when doing ground attack mission

Backlog:
-Add single player option: 
--As a player I want to select which plane I'll be flying.
--Determine correct player plane
--Mission briefing ??

-Make waypoints Icons better: position x,y dependent on next waypoint
-Stalingrad capponniers add entity/faction (zombies)
-Add Ju52 as option, but need weight implemented in random choice
Rewrite plane config with proper key????

first step: Read map specific plane config in json once
-use list().values for selecting random planes
-use dict for reading selected plane from config.

Or completely rewrite GUI. Use key, show value in button.

plane config:
 plane id, name, [role1, role2], [attack config, attack mod], [bomber config, bomber mod], weight?

-Implement "weight" while choosing planes, include "historical"
-implement radar function 

-Potential Objectives: Convoy, Factory, Harbour, Tank, Garrison, Coms Tower, Supply Ships, 
Stronghold, Submarine pen, Air support for ground assault, Invasion (protect your own airfield)

-enhance mission description/ more random phrases?

-Support multiple front lines/situations (based on date/time progression):

Objectives can be created inside "phase/ line" group and then added to default objective group before selecting one.
Or: put phase number in objective name, ie " objective_allied_<phase mask>_1 inside "Objective_train".
Mask should provide if yes/no allowed in selected phase: "00001" = allowed in phase 5, "00110", allowed in phase 3 and 4. 

-Create multiple groups phase_1 to phase_n
-Each phase contains: Player flights (start airfields), Lines (icons+influence areas), helpers, objectives
-Is this all in one template??????? Or do we choose different template? -> easier to keep generic stuff in one template (scenery/logic)

-Add own mission name -> why???


-Radio: warning for fighters
-call backup?

###############################
-Generate new mission during lobby timeout? -> Poll rcon?

-data hiding: which global variables are used in functions? -> the mission/template files

Design:

choose day/time
choose weather

choose map/lines
choose situation (offensive/defensive)

Choose operations area

Read static objects
Read active objects and cluster around operations area (vehicles, aaa etc)

per side:

   choose objective / restrict objective locations based on lines

   choose type of flights / depends on objective & situation
   per flight:
      choose objective.task
      choose plane types based on task
      choose loadout based on task
      choose timing: air start/ground start (start/in progress/returning)
      choose waypoints / restrict wp locations based on objective

Define function get block:
   Find block and isolate as one text block without leading tabs

Define function get group:
   Find all blocks in group and get them

Define function save block
   Add block to total mission file (no groups except for static)

Define function move group
   Transform xyz cords of all blocks based on transformation vector. One object for reference.
   
What structure to use to store and group blocks so they can be used for transformations -> List of Block object

Objects:
Plane: standard+type, loadout etc
Standard block: x,y,z
